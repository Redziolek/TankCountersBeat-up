        ALPHA 0.2 - 31.10.2023<br />
        <br />
        1.LEVELLING REWORK<br />
        <br />
        I've come up to a conclusion that keeping the same exact level system as
        in brawl stars makes no sense in an RPG Maker game and it won't be fun
        at all.<br />
        <br />
        Here's how it works now:<br />
        -Brawlers will have 40 levels.<br />
        -Because of 40 levels instead of 11, the scaling will match the one from
        before the September 2023 update. In other words, the numbers, at least
        at the max level<br />
        will be the same as before the hypercharge update, but the values are
        spread across 40 levels instead of 11.<br />
        -Level scaling: 5% --> 1,25%<br />
        <br />
        Take a closer look to understand what I mean:<br />
        <br />
        El Primo:<br />
        <br />
        lvl1-6075HP<br />
        lvl2-6150HP<br />
        lvl3-6225HP<br />
        lvl4-6300HP<br />
        <br />
        and so on... +75HP each level, which is 1,25% scaling instead of
        previous 5%. (0,0125 * 6000 = 75)<br />
        <br />
        lvl40-9000HP<br />
        <br />
        The power 11 HP stays untouched, just as it was before the update.<br />
        <br />
        lvl1-0MP<br />
        lvl40-500MP<br />
        <br />
        (usually it's around +13 per level, all brawlers have the same MP
        amount)<br />
        <br />
        2.NEW BRAWLER BUSTER<br />
